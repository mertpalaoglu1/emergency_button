# emergency_button
I was very bored at my Intership and want to do something fun but I also dont want to get caught slacking so I made this.
It has a configurable keyboard button and path setting. When you press the keyboard button. It opens the file path and you can pretend like your working that moment. 
That's exactly what i did today. 

# How to use
1-Open terminal 

2-Go to folders path with cd "filepath" (Write the path that you put the folder)

3-Start the script with python emergency_button.py and hide the terminal

4-Go crazy


(The terminal is supposed to be working in the background)

# Requirements
Python 3.7+
keyboard module (pip install keyboard)
