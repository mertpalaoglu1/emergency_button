# emergency_button
I was very bored at my Intership and want to do something fun but I also dont want to get caught slacking so I made this.
It has a configurable keyboard button and path setting. When you press the keyboard button. It opens the file path and you can pretend like your working that moment. 
That's exactly what i did today. 

# How to use
Open terminal 
Go to folders path with cd "filepath" (Write the path that you put the folder)
Start the script with python emergency_button.py and hide the terminal
Go crazy

(The terminal is supposed to be open background)
