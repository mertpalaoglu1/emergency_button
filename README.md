# emergency_button
I was very bored at my Intership and want to do something fun but I also dont want to get caught slacking so I made this.
It has a configurable keyboard button and path setting. When you press the keyboard button. It opens the file path and you can pretend like your working that moment. 
That's exactly what i did today.
